#  OPUSAUDIT - WhatsApp Audio Analysis Tool

  

**OPUSAUDIT** is a tool developed for **digital forensic analysis** and **cybersecurity awareness**. It can be used by professionals in judicial investigations as well as by cybersecurity teams in awareness campaigns to demonstrate the sensitivity of information transmitted via audio on **Android** devices.

  

##  What is it for?

  

OPUSAUDIT allows you to analyze WhatsApp audios stored on an **Android** device, automatically extracting them via ADB and processing them with artificial intelligence to search for sensitive keywords such as passwords, banking data, usernames, or any personal information that could pose a risk if intercepted by a cybercriminal.

  

##  Use cases

  

- **Digital forensics:** Search for names, passwords, keys, and patterns in audios related to judicial investigations.

-  **Awareness campaigns:** Demonstrate the impact of audio data leaks to companies or users.

- **Privacy audits:** Verification of critical information leaked via voice messages.

## ðŸ›  How does it work?

  

1. Connect an Android phone with **USB Debugging** enabled.

2. OPUSAUDIT automatically extracts WhatsApp voice messages.

3. Uses **Whisper** (OpenAI's transcription model) to convert audio to text.

4. Analyzes transcriptions for **sensitive keywords**.

5. Displays potential findings on screen and saves them to a file (`secretleak.txt`).

-  **Spanish default filters:**  `tarjeta de credito`, `contraseÃ±a`, `clave`, `usuario`, `tarjeta`, `correo`, `acceso`, `banco`

  

5. Click **"Start analysis"** / **"Iniciar anÃ¡lisis"**.

6. The tool will show step by step:

-  Audio extraction

- Transcription with Whisper

- Keyword search

- Found results

  

7. Upon completion, it will show a summary of detected content and generate a file called `secretleak.txt` with the results and the audios used.
